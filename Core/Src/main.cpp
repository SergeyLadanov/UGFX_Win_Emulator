/******************************************************************************
 * This project provides two demo applications.  A simple blinky style project,
 * and a more comprehensive test and demo application.  The
 * mainCREATE_SIMPLE_BLINKY_DEMO_ONLY setting is used to select between the two.
 * The simply blinky demo is implemented and described in main_blinky.c.  The
 * more comprehensive test and demo application is implemented and described in
 * main_full.c.
 *
 * This file implements the code that is not demo specific, including the
 * hardware setup and FreeRTOS hook functions.
 *
 *******************************************************************************
 * NOTE: Windows will not be running the FreeRTOS demo threads continuously, so
 * do not expect to get real time behaviour from the FreeRTOS Windows port, or
 * this demo application.  Also, the timing information in the FreeRTOS+Trace
 * logs have no meaningful units.  See the documentation page for the Windows
 * port for further information:
 * https://www.FreeRTOS.org/FreeRTOS-Windows-Simulator-Emulator-for-Visual-Studio-and-Eclipse-MingW.html
